Module: Unsupervised Learning Implementation for Quantitative Finance Portfolio
This module contains functions for implementing unsupervised learning techniques for a quantitative finance portfolio.

Requirements:
- Must be generic and applicable to various quantitative finance scenarios.
- Proper docstrings, type hints, and error handling are included.
- Libraries used: vector databases, r, Databricks, Generative AI, spark.
- Demonstrates quant skills in supervised learning, NLP, and MLOps.
- Example usage is provided in the __main__ block.
- Production-ready and portfolio-quality code.
